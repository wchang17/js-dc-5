# Class 04: Functions
Now that we know how to work with data and control when certain actions are performed by our program, we need a way to encapsulate code so we can reuse it. Functions let us write code that will perform an action whenever we ask it to do so.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what functions are and how, when and why to use them
- Declare our first function
- Understand parameters and arguments and how they relate to functions
- Understand the basics of scope
- Create and call a function that accepts parameters to solve a problem

## Assignment
* Exercise 04 in the `exercises` folder

## Optional Reading
* [Functions, Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
* [Higher Order Functions, Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
* [Functions, Understanding ES6](https://github.com/nzakas/understandinges6/blob/master/manuscript/03-Functions.md)
* Get ready for the upcoming lab!

The lab will be next Tuesday, May 30th and you'll have almost all class to work on it. The homework assigned next class will build off of today's homework and help prepare you for the lab. That said, if there's anything you still feel even remotely shaky on - come to office hours or reach out over slack and review what we've covered so far!
