Exercise Two
The event object

*/



/*

Get an array of all the buttons on the screen. Write an event handler that just
`console.log`s "you clicked a button" when called. Loop over your array of
buttons and attach our event handler to each button

*/



/*

Refactor your event handler so that it `console.log`s the event object. Poke
around the event object

*/



/*

Refactor your event handler so that it `console.log`s the target subobject

*/



/*

Student activity:
Do one more refactor of the event handler. Your event handler should:

1. get the increment/decrement value from the event target
2. turn that value into a number
3. add the increment/decrement value to the current value of counterIndex and
update the page

Hint: any data that we define in our html with data-* will be in our elements
`dataset` property
