# Class 17: Deployment
For our last lesson, we'll cover making our applications live and
publishing them so that others can see and use them!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between static and dynamic applications
- Learn how to deploy static sites
- Learn how to deploy a dynamic site

## Materials
- [Slides](https://ga-students.github.io/JS-DC/17-deployment)
- [Lesson Notes](17-deployment/lesson_plan.md)

## Assignment
Your assignment for next class is to review your notes on deployment and to get started on your final project.
The deliverables for next class are:
- Create a new repository under your own GitHub account for your final project.
- Clone the repository locally (NOT in to an existing repository!) and add a `readme.md` or edit the one created by GitHub
- Add a short description of your project
- Add a short description of your UI and the views of your application
- Draft the technical requirements of your application, specifically the features you'll build out and how each filter will work. 3 features tends to be the sweet spot for final projects. 
- Add a link to your final project repository to the file you created in the `final-projects/` folder of the class repository listing your project ideas. Add, Commit, Push, and make a Pull Request. In the comments of the pull request (where you answer the 3 questions) paste the link to your final project again.

See the sample in the `final-project/` folder of the class repository, `sample-readme.md`, for how to flush our the readme file you're creating.

__Feel free to get started on your project!__
