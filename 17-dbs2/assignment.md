# Final Project
Create a repository for your final project. Create a `.txt` file in the final project folder with the link to your repository in it. Commit the file, push it, and make a pull request on this repository so that we have the links.

Add a `readme.md` file to the readme for your final project. Your readme should include 3 sections:

1. Overview
  - This section should describe our project heuristically: what features will it have, what problems will it solve, etc?
2. UI Draft
  - This section should describe the views for your application. What pages will your app have, what sections will you have in those pages? You can draw your views and include the images here.
3. Technical Requirements
  - This section should describe each feature in detail: how will each feature work, walking through the code you'll write at a high level, from start to finish.

See the final project folder for a sample readme.
