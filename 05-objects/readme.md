# Class 05: Objects
Our final class on Javascript as a language covers Objects. This lesson will also cover Object Oriented Programming, a paradigm often held in opposition to Functional Programming, which we talked about in the last class.

## Learning Objectives
- Create and modify JavaScript Objects
- Use Objects to model complex data
- Get and Set properties of Objects

## Materials
- [Slides](https://ga-students.github.io/JS-DC/05-objects)
- [Lesson Notes](https://github.com/ga-students/JS-DC/tree/master/05-objects)
- [Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jAj3ZullDA)

## Key Takeaways
- How do I create a new object?
- Describe the 'anatomy' of an object?
- What are each of: properties, methods, and key-value pairs?
- What makes objects powerful/useful? (Think about what we use them for, not just what they do)

## Assignment
Homework for tonight is to complete the exercise in the assignment directory. You'll notice it's pretty similar to the last assignment but incorporates object
oriented programming.

## Review
The following is (highly) recommended reading for you, if you'd like to review any of the material we've covered in the first part of the course.

I recommend that you finish it before next Tuesday's class, when we start our first lab. By no means is any of this *assigned*, but it would definitely behoove you
to ensure you have a solid understanding of these concepts before we start working on the lab!
