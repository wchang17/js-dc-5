Create class modelling a card. Each card should have a suit, rank and
score as well as a title. The title should be a string descriptor for 
the card, like 'Ace of Hearts' or 'Four of Clubs'

Test out your class by creating a new card, `console.log`ing it to 
make sure you're getting what you expect. You should get something like:
{
  suit: 'hearts',
  rank: 'ace',
  title: 'ace of hearts',
  score: 1
}

    this.title = `${rank} of ${suit}`
  }
}

let queenOfHearts = new Card('queen', 'hearts')
console.log( queenOfHearts )

/*

Write a class for a deck of cards. The deck should contain a property 
`cards` that is an array of the cards in the current deck.

Your deck should contain a method called `createNewDeck` that will 
populate the `cards` array with all 52 card posibilities, using your 
card object from above. Someone should not be able to create a new 
deck of 52 cards if the deck's `cards` array already has cards in it

console.log( testDeck )


/*

Write a class called Player. A player should have a username that is 
a string and a hand that is an array of cards.

Instantiate two instances of your player class.

*/

class Player {
  constructor( username ) {

/*

Get pumped:
For our lab, we're going to have two mini lessons: one on `npm`, which 
stands for node package manager and installing 3rd party libraries,
perhaps to help us handle user input; the second will be on breaking 
our program into multiple files.

After that, we'll finish building out the game and you'll actually be 
able to play it!
