Final Project Ideas:

1. Build a one page App that lets the user know what events are happening in DC on a specific day
    - The user will input their zip code and the date
    - The page will render results in list form
    - Bonus: Display ratings of events

2. Build an app that searches flight prices for all airlines
	- User will input date of flight, departure airport, and destination airport
	- Results will display price and flight information

3. Create a site that collects articles from conservative, independent and liberal news outlets.
	- Everyday article links, titles, and descriptions will be posted
	- Users can comment on the posts
