## Assignment
Review the HackerWall source code and make sure you are comfortable with
the material before the start of our lab on Thursday!

Create an `ideas.md` file in the `final-project/` directory of your
repository and briefly describe 3 ideas you have for your final project.
Your descriptions do not need to be in depth, we will get to that part
later, for now just include what the idea is and a description of how it
will work in less than 100 words.
