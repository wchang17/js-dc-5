# HackerWall

For our group lab, we'll be building an application called HackerWall - it's just like HackerNews, but built by us - so better. Much better.

The core features of HackerWall are:
  - Anyone can post an article to HackerWall by filling in a form that takes: a link to an article or web page, a title, and a description
  - Every article appears on the HackerWall homepage in order that they are posted
  - Users can comment on each article

Bonus features for HackerWall include:
  - the ability to up-vote and down-vote posts
  - form validation (users can't submit comments or new posts with empty fields)

Checkout the real [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and play around with it to get a feel for it's feature set.

# Domain Modeling

We need to spend some time thinking about what data our application will use and how it will use it.

What entities will our application have?

What properties will that entity or those entities have?

How will we need to work with our entity? (create new ones? edit them? delete them?)

The best practice is to think about each entity or object that your application will rely on and what properties those entities will have.

# Create a Project Plan

Now that we know what entities we will need to build out in our application, we need to get started! But, rather than just jump into the console and start coding, lets plan out what we'll need to build.

What steps can we piece out to get us through from start to finish?

What are a couple of goal posts we can work towards, based on what entities and features we need to build out?

Which features should we build first and why?

# Coding!

Lets get going!
